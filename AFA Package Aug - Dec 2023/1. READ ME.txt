According to the AFA constitution, Article VIII(8), Section I(1), the Data Collection Team shall be headed by the General Secretary. The committee maintains the right to introduce any other bylaws regarding the transfer policy before starting the transfer window.




** Transfer Window Details for Fall 2023 Season **

##. As per the latest decree, it is now mandatory for every player and every manager to execute a new contractual agreement at the commencement of each subsequent academic semester, which marks the opening of a new season. Notably, a player or a manager is exclusively permitted to terminate said contractual arrangement solely during the opening of the Mid-Season Transfer Window. During this period, the player or the manager can transfer their allegiance to a different club. Therefore, during Mid-Season Transfer Window, a player can not transfer to another team without first terminating their existing contract with their current club. The same goes for a manager.

If a player or a manager fails to partake in the Fall 2023 Transfer Window, they shall be deemed ineligible to participate in any AFA competition until they formalize an agreement with a club upon the commencement of the Mid-Season Transfer Window.

It is of significant importance to emphasize that should a player or a manager forego participation in both aforementioned transfer windows, their eligibility to partake in any AFA competition shall be nullified.

It is essential for managers to participate in the contractual process, as their involvement serves to clarify the responsible party within the club, particularly during occasions of acknowledgement and award distribution. By ensuring their signature on contracts, the club can establish a clear chain of authority and accountability, contributing to smooth operations and efficient decision-making.

##. In accordance with the regulations, every APL club is authorized to enlist a maximum of 25 players with at least 1 player serving as a goalkeeper. Moreover, it is stipulated that each APL club must secure a minimum of 15 players, with at least 1 player serving as a goalkeeper.
    
During the Mid-Season Transfer Window, teams are granted the privilege of signing a maximum of 5 players, with the condition that only 1 of these signings may occupy the position of goalkeeper. Compliance with these provisions is mandatory to ensure adherence to the league's guidelines and maintain fair and competitive standards among the participating clubs.

##. In relation to the termination of the contract, the endorsement of the AFA assumes significance as a requisite for substantiating the termination. In the context of a coach's contract termination, only the endorsement or consent of the coach and the AFA President holds a requisite status. It is imperative to underscore that, for the termination of a player's contract, the concurrence of their coach stands as a precondition. Under no circumstances should a coach withhold a player's prerogative to effectuate the termination of their contract, save for the circumstance where the stipulated transfer window is concluded. In regard to this pertinent matter, any purported manager found to be in violation of this principle, subsequent to formal reporting, diligent investigation, and conclusive establishment of guilt, shall be subject to appropriate sanctions.




** How contracts will be collected **

##. Hardcopy and in-person. Players are to print the contract forms and fill them up manually or they can fill the contract electronically and then print it out.
Signed contracts should be submitted to any of these 3 AFA executives: 1. General Secretary 2. AFA president 3. AFA Vice-president.
A player's contract is only deemed valid if it's submitted before the close of the transfer window. However, 12 hours extension period will be tolerated to make up for any inconveniences.
